    <td>So we are now onto are next week of codecademy let's get on with the second week of work on codecademy  and I have to say I think that the amount of work I got through today was great it was the second and third subtopic  a lot  from what we did two terms ago. First we logged on to codecademy but not after we made our new accounts. We carried on with Python.  Our task was to carry on from where we got last week which was to do what was under the second subtopic. Which I completed and finished the third topic as well.</td>

    <td>I think that  the progress I am making its great I've already finished 3 subtopics so I made  a massive leap forward in improving every lesson  since the last term we did I.T there is becoming less and less and less for me to work on we just get on with the work and see how far we can get to. I think even though  I think I did well there is no such thing as too much focus so I will improve on focusing on my own work so that I won't miss anything.</td>

    <td> Even though  I think I did well there is no such thing as too much focus so I will improve on focusing on my own work so that I won’t miss anything. As well as not dwelling on things that don’t need to be dwelled on. Those are the main things that I would improve on for next lesson for I.T on Thursday.<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Bfm4EYOtHT2qIY9vRUtUM80VYVjV3wSL/preview" width="640" height="480"></iframe>
