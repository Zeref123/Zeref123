    <td>I found not concentrating on others around you and solely concentrating on your work was a good starting point and it helped me to get far. Also I asked questions when needed from the teacher and students around me. Although being independent is a great thing to start of with if you're stuck or need some help then I think that it's a good thing to ask questions.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I think that it would be even better if I referred more to the notes and resources available. To focus more is also something that would take my work to a higher standard in a faster amount of time. But after all that happened and all that I did I think that the biggest thing is that I got stuck on one part and didn't move on. So during the last fifteen minutes of the lesson I only looked and focus on that part and as a result I wasted the last part of the lesson and that's why I did not finish.   </td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I think next time I want to achieve finishing my work in the lesson and not take any home. And again I need to focus more on my work. Next time I will definitely move on and not just stay at one point in the lesson. I will also need to bring in a memory stick for some reason. Even though the lesson today was our first lesson and we missed most of it , it was a good lesson for IT.</td>
