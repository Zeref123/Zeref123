    <td>We finally made it into week 6 of our Fuze box workout. We went and collected our Fuze boxes and our cables from Mr Ampah-Korsah. We went per usual in our group number which is 8. I got the cables, Cooper got the Fuze box and Matthew plugged them in. Then we got straight into the work in the Fuze box manual. Today we started trying to make a guessing game where you have to guess a number 1 to 100 and see if you get it right.   </td>

  <tr>
    <td>Again I think as this as following a pattern but I still don't really quite know yet what I need to do except for the same thing as last week so just like last week and the week before I need to improve on not dwelling on the same thing for a long time or as I also said last week about my getting distracted easily and needing to move on quicker so we can do even more work.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>As I said now for 2 weeks running and above in the last paragraph I will improve on focusing on my own work so I can get further than I would have on the I.T work. As well as not dwelling on things that donâ€™t need to be dwelled on. Those are the like I said last week the main things that I would improve on for next lesson for I.T on Monday.</td>
