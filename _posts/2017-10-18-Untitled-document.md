    <td>How did I learn? What strategies were effective? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> In this lesson we were still looking at the fuze boxes which was a quite  new experience as this was only our second lesson using them. We first got our fuze boxes and with that a mouse and a cable and a instruction guide as always. Me and Rob took turns being navigator and driver. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson was pretty much the same as the last weeks lesson, the work was different but we were doing the same thing I need to improve my habit of getting distracted easily. Although it's true I feel I worked well I still think I can do better.  I hope all the lessons are like this as its new and a fun thing. I want to use the knowledge I learn to make something on the fuze boxes and see how it turns out.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will carry on improving my habits of not listening and/or getting distracted. Overall I think today was a fun lesson that may or may not benefit me in the future. </td>
