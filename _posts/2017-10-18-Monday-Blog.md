  <tr>
    <td> In this lesson we were looking at the fuze boxes which was a new experience. We first got our fuze boxes and with that a mouse and a cable and a instruction guide. I found it kind of confusing but I always had my trusty Robert who helped me throughout the lesson as we worked together.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson was a lot different compared to any of the lessons I've had before, not only was the work different but I feel that I managed to focus a lot more than last year, which I think helped me keep track of time a bit better than last year but also improved my work by a quite large amount.
I need to improve my habit of getting distracted easily. Although it's true I feel I worked well I still think I can do better.  </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>I will improve my habit of not being alert by ignoring the distractions and always listening when the teacher is talking because they most probably know better.
Overall I think today was a fun lesson that may or may not benefit me in the future . </td>
