**What I need to improve on:**

As I think I already said from week 1-4 or beyond I need to probably improve my concentration on my work so that  I won't  miss anything  when someone is speaking and trying to help others like me. As well as not dwelling on things that donâ€™t need to be dwelled on. I would say that those are the main things that I would improve on for I.T.
