    <td>Today I got passed finished all the Python topics.  I am now finished with all  Python and am sure that I might have something very interesting to do soon. I am looking forward to that and hope it will be a positive learning experience. For Python I think that using the hints provided was a good way to either start of your code or to get help going through it. Although I think I relied a bit too much on the hints but I still managed to learn about Python coding.</td>

    <td> So I think that I am smashing through the Python work and am nearing the end but even though I think I am doing very well there is no such thing as too much focus so I will improve on focusing on my own work so that I won't miss anything. I finished the Python topic as a whole now and I'm going to try hard to be able to do that. I am excited to see what I will be doing next.</td>

    <td> Alright so I need to focus extra hard on my work nope as i have set myself a goal which is to finish the topic of Python . Now onto my target I did well there is no such thing as too much focus so I will improve on focusing on my own work so that I wonâ€™t miss anything. Those are the main things that I would improve on for next lesson for I.T on Thursday.</td>
