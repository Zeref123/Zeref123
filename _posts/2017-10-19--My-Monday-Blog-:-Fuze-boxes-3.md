    <td> In this lesson we were still looking at the fuze boxes which is always very fun and gets even better as we move through the booklet. First we went got our fuze boxes and with that a mouse and a cable and a instruction guide as always. We also switched groups so now I'm with Cooper.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson was pretty much the same as the last weeks lesson but we did change groups and the work was different but we were doing the same thing in general. I need to improve my habit of getting distracted easily. I worked the same as i did last lesson.  I hope all the lessons are like this as its new and a fun thing. I want to use the knowledge I learn to make something on the fuze boxes and see how it turns out.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I will carry on improving my habits of not listening and/or getting distracted. Overall I think today was a fun lesson that may or may not benefit me in the future. </td>
